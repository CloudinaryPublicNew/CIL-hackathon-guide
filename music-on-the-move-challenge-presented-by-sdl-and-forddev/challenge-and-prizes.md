# Challenge & Prizes

_**Music on the Move Challenge, Presented by SDL & FordDev**_

How can APIs evolve music listening in the car to become an immersive lifestyle that delivers just-in-time content, personalized experiences, and connect fans with all aspects of their favorite artists?

SDL APIs already enable streaming music from favorites such as iHeartRadio and Pandora. The SDL _Music on the Move_ challenge wants to see where our innovative developer community can take drivers by connecting with additional API providers or your own solutions to deliver compelling 360 artist experiences not just by bringing audio in to the car but also harnessing the unique opportunity to actually navigate listeners to the artists through events, merchandise, and more!

SDL enables app developers to connect their content in the vehicle, extending the command and control capabilities from the app directly in to the vehicle screens and controls. No code needs to be embedded in the vehicle and all of the UI is simplified through the use of templates, which also ensures that distracted driver guidelines are not a concern.

Music industry leaders such as iHeartRadio, Slacker Radio \(now LiveXLive\) and Pandora have been streaming in cars using SDL for years and are joined today by innovative services like Dash Radio. Not just for streaming music, SDL enables productivity through apps like WebEx and Waze, and connects Alexa users in Ford and Toyota vehicles.

If you have new and unique ideas on how SDL can empower Capitol artists to step across the lines between in-car listening and live interaction, auto industry giants such as Ford, Toyota and Subaru want you to join this challenge!

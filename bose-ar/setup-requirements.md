# Setup Requirements

The Bose AR SDK includes access to things like listening to sensor data, searching for Bluetooth devices, and listening to the connection events of the Bose AR-enabled devices. The SDK binary contains four example projects for developers to learn from. This guide is part of a sequence of upcoming codelabs that will help you develop with the SDK. The first part of understanding is to play with some examples and see how the Frames interacts with the SDK.

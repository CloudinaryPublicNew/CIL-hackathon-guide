## November **2019 Thought Starters** <a id="june-2-3-thought-starters"></a>

### **Theme**: Music on the Move

Our category challenges for November are below but all ideas at the intersection of music-tech are fair game!

* **UMG Challenge:** We’ll be hosting a number of Artist specific challenges. Details to Come. If you’re interested, be sure to [opt in](https://capitol360.wufoo.com/forms/m1f12jl70w0h9lh/) with any ideas you have around fan engagement tools!
* **Bose AR Challenge:** Design and develop an immersive mobile music experience built for Bose AR
* **Dolby IO Challenge:** Making your audio sound great is hard, so we've built some APIs to make it a lot easier.  We're looking for your creativity to build apps that use these APIs to improve the quality of \(and gain insight into\) music, podcasts, and other recorded media.
*  **Cloudinary Challenge:** Create an experience for artists and/or music fans implementing Cloudinary’s Video API
* **Music on the Move Challenge, Presented by SDL & FordDev:** How can APIs evolve music listening in the car to become an immersive lifestyle that delivers just-in-time content, personalized experiences, and connect fans with all aspects of their favorite artists?

  Today, one feature of [SDL](www.smartdevicelink.com) APIs is to enable streaming music from favorites such as iHeartRadio and Pandora in millions of vehicles around the world.  The SDL _Music on the Move_ challenge wants to see how our innovative developer community can take advantage of the unique opportunity cars offer. Not just bringing music into the car...but the ability to actually bring fans to the music!  By connecting with additional API providers or your own platform, how can you deliver compelling 360 artist experiences, navigate listeners to artist events, drive merchandise sales, and more!  [Apply for your seat](https://capitol360.wufoo.com/forms/m1f12jl70w0h9lh/) and chance to win the $10,000 1st place prize now! Spots are limited and will fill up quickly.

* [**Hypno Challenge**](hypno-challenge.md)**:** Hypno invites the developer community to its [instant camera API](https://instant.hypno.com/), which mixes photos and videos with music and special effects in real-time. Our technology makes it easy for artists to shoot and share mini music videos, for example, and for fans to participate and contribute videos of their own. We're excited to see how the developer community uses Hypno to empower the next generation of artists... and shape the future of music. The winning team will be awarded $1500 cash at Capitol Royale. All developers who integrate our API into any of the challenges will receive a limited-edition reflective Hypno long sleeve tee — and a VIP invite to Hypno Happy Hour.

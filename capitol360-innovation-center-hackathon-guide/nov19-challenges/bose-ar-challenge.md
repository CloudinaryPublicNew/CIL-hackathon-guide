# Bose AR Challenge

We know getting started can be a challenge, so we've put together a series of thought starters to inspire your creativity.

Three key areas to explore include:

* Spatial Audio
* Augmented Reality
* Streaming Music

**Motown Museum Walking Tour + Musical Moments:** Create a walking tour that will immerse consumers in historical facts about the block that that original Motown studio is located. This tour will use the GPS to pinpoint exact locations of meetings, where old landmarks used to be \(like the green couch on the porch\), and more. There could also be an option to buy merchandise from the artists that are explained along the tour.

**Spatial awareness games driven by Motown content:** Break down a track by instrument and have players walk toward the strings, vocals, drums, etc.

**Additional information on artists the consumer is listening to:** Mic listens to song you’re listening to, and gives you information about the artist \(e.g.when they’re in your area on tour using the GPS\).

**Spatial audio in room scavenger hunt:** Take scavenger hunts to the next level by using only spatial audio to unlock clues and find answers. 

**Music history walking tour:** Create a one-of-a-kind experience for music lovers to go on a spatial audio walking tours in some of the most historic musical cities including New Orleans, Nashville, and Hollywood.

**Capitol Music Group Milestone Anniversaries:** This year, Capitol Music Group is celebrating Motown's 60th and Blue Note 80th anniversary. We are looking to release special edition and anniversary compilation, and would love to see experiences built around these tentpole moments.

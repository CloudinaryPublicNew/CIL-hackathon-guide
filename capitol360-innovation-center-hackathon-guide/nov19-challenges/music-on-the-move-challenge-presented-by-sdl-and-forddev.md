_**Music on the Move Challenge, Presented by**_ [_**SDL**_](https://smartdevicelink.com) _**&**_ [_**FordDev**_](https://developer.ford.com/)_\*\*\*\*_

How can APIs evolve music listening in the car to become an immersive lifestyle that delivers just-in-time content, personalized experiences, and connect fans with all aspects of their favorite artists?

SDL APIs already enable streaming music from favorites such as iHeartRadio and Pandora. The SDL _Music on the Move_ challenge wants to see where our innovative developer community can take drivers by connecting with additional API providers or your own solutions to deliver compelling 360 artist experiences not just by bringing audio in to the car but also harnessing the unique opportunity to actually navigate listeners to the artists through events, merchandise, and more!

SDL enables app developers to connect their content in the vehicle, extending the command and control capabilities from the app directly in to the vehicle screens and controls. No code needs to be embedded in the vehicle and all of the UI is simplified through the use of templates, which also ensures that distracted driver guidelines are not a concern.

Music industry leaders such as iHeartRadio, Slacker Radio \(now LiveXLive\) and Pandora have been streaming in cars using SDL for years and are joined today by innovative services like Dash Radio. Not just for streaming music, SDL enables productivity through apps like WebEx and Waze, and connects Alexa users in Ford and Toyota vehicles.

If you have new and unique ideas on how SDL can empower Capitol artists to step across the lines between in-car listening and live interaction, auto industry giants such as Ford, Toyota and Subaru want you to join this challenge!

●     Have the chance to win a grand prize of $10,000 cash PLUS support for integrating winning app.

[**SDL**](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsmartdevicelink.com%2F&data=02%7C01%7CChingChing.Chen%40umusic.com%7Cd927e69dfa464dc2dbc108d743620e97%7Cbbcb6b2f8c7c4e2486e46c36fed00b78%7C1%7C0%7C637051960749037882&sdata=dnfqbq%2Fd6nRFp37bFpMpdFeF2KfGr%2B%2BoQ8LQ1%2FGZUcE%3D&reserved=0) is the industry standard for open source in-vehicle connectivity. For automakers and suppliers, SDL adoption broadens the choices for customers in how they connect and control their smartphones while on the move. SDL is the open source software on which the Ford AppLink platform is built. Industry adoption of SDL provides significant benefits to developers interested in connecting their apps for safer in-vehicle use.

The [Ford Developer Program](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fford.to%2F2uKi7OT&data=02%7C01%7CChingChing.Chen%40umusic.com%7Cd927e69dfa464dc2dbc108d743620e97%7Cbbcb6b2f8c7c4e2486e46c36fed00b78%7C1%7C0%7C637051960749047878&sdata=A3m6n%2FkRNaX5HKq81WXKgF58ujEh6Z1qo2z2GDHK2vI%3D&reserved=0) opened its doors at CES in 2013, commemorating the 150th anniversary of Henry Ford’s birth, celebrating his innovative spirit and his belief that to create something truly great, he needed to surround himself with other likeminded individuals. By creating the automotive industry’s first end-to-end developer ecosystem, Ford invited developers from all across the globe to innovate and see their content enjoyed in the vehicle in a way never seen before and over 30,000 developers have done so. At this monumental event, Ford contributed the AppLink core to the open source community…and SDL was born!

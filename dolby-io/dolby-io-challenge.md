# Dolby IO Challenge

Making your audio sound great is hard, so we've built some APIs to make it a lot easier.  We're looking for your creativity to build apps that use these APIs to improve the quality of \(and gain insight into\) music, podcasts, and other recorded media.  

We want you to explore how dialog-based and music-based content complement each other for more immersive experiences and deeper fan engagement.  Use the Dolby APIs to improve spoken word recordings that may have been captured while on the move such as with mobile devices, poor recording equipment, or in noisy environments. Explore opportunities to enhance the dialog, classify music and sounds, and collaborate for improved audio experiences.
